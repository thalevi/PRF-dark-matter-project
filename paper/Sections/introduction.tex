\greg{Does anyone know why the PDF doesn't have the index on the left hand side with links to all of the sections?}

\greg{To me, one of the nice things about these primitives is how elegant and
simple they are.  (e.g., I showed the (2,3)-OWF to a colleague and his reaction
was, wow this is so simple, just two matrix multiplies, can it really be a
OWF?) Esp.  when we compare the (2,3)-OWF to a (MPC-friendly) block cipher. But
the simplicity doesn't really come across in the description of Section 3,
maybe the introduction is a good place to make the point (and give a
description of the (2,3)-OWF as an example).  }
